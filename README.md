### Hi there 👋, 
# My name is Martin
### I am an IT student that probably writes code
Currently I am studying IT where I mostly use HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JS. But at home or during breaks in school I like to dabble in Python where I use Django, Selenium and I will try to get into some machine learning soon.
